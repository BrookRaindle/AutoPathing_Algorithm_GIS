# AutoPathing_Algorithm_GIS
Final year thesis project - Autonomous pathfinding algorithm using Geographic Information Systems

This project First explored the Process of using QGIS, a platform for manipulating datafiles
uses SQL Queries and pre-built Functions to change the data to be applicable to the desired usage. 

Once data is Pre-Processed NetworkX (Python Package) is used to perform Route finding algorithms, providing multiple desirable optimization settings. 
This is my first attempt at an autopathing algorithm.
My ultimate goal was to create a modular platform, where i can add whatever features i want to the route finding algorithm, with the final step being implementing Off-Road pathfinding into it. 
I didnt get that far as to adding offroad, however on road applications, over the smaller 'Test Region', are reasonably functional.

This is by no means perfect, but it gave me a good understanding over how Geographic information systems are used in modern technology, but might not be the most efficient method to achieve the goal.
